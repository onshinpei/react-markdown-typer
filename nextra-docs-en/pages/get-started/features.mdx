## Optimized for AI Applications

**Automatic Streaming Data Splitting**

Do regular typewriters stutter with AI streaming data? We don't. Automatically splits each chunk into characters, ensuring smooth character-by-character rendering no matter how much the backend pushes at once.

## Lightweight yet Powerful

- Built on industry-standard [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
- Zero additional dependencies, works out of the box
- Full Markdown syntax support

## Complete Typing Control

Not just playing animations, but also:

- **Pause** - `stop()`
- **Resume** - `resume()`
- **Restart** - `restart()`
- **Clear** - `clear()`

Full imperative API gives you complete control.
