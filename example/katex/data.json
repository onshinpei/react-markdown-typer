  "content": "**What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**  \n\nThe **Pythagorean Theorem** is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. It states that:  \n\n> **In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.**  \n\nMathematically, it is expressed as:  \n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\\]  \nwhere:  \n- \\( c \\) is the length of the **hypotenuse**,  \n- \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the lengths of the other two sides (legs).  \n\n### Example  \nIf a right triangle has legs of lengths 3 and 4, the hypotenuse \\( c \\) can be calculated as:  \n\\[\n3^2 + 4^2 = c^2 \\implies 9 + 16 = c^2 \\implies c = \\sqrt{25} = 5.\n\\]  \n\n### Applications  \nThe theorem is widely used in architecture, physics, engineering, and computer science for calculating distances, angles, and solving real-world problems involving right triangles.  \n\n### History  \nNamed after the ancient Greek mathematician **Pythagoras** (or his followers), though evidence suggests the principle was known to Babylonians and Indians earlier.  \n\nWould you like a proof or further details? ðŸ˜Š",
